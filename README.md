Final report available [here](https://alrabeahali345706609.wordpress.com/2021/11/30/meteorite-visualization/).

Utilizing a publicly available data set from [NASA's Open Data Portal](https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh), we hoped to provide a geographical display of the dataset by creating a dashboard-like interface with a large and interactive map, various plots with statistical analysis, and an accompanying control panel to change the display of the map. 
<br>
<br>
Our target audience is both newcomers and experts-alike, so it's important that our interface has an intended design philosophy to cater to both parties. 
<br>
<br>
Due to this, we made our primary goal to make this interface using an effective, but minimal approach; providing enough information but not too much to overwhelm newcomers.
